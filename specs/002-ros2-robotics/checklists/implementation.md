# Implementation Tasks Quality Checklist: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Purpose**: Validate implementation tasks completeness and quality before proceeding to execution
**Created**: 2025-12-23
**Feature**: [Link to tasks.md](./../tasks.md)

## Task Quality

- [x] All tasks follow the required checklist format (- [ ] T### [Story])
- [x] Tasks are organized by user story for independent implementation
- [x] Each task has a clear, specific description with file path
- [x] Parallelizable tasks are marked with [P] flag
- [x] User story tasks are marked with [US#] flag
- [x] Task dependencies are clearly identified

## Implementation Completeness

- [x] Phase 1: Setup tasks cover project initialization
- [x] Phase 2: Foundational tasks cover blocking prerequisites
- [x] Phase 3+: User stories in priority order from spec
- [x] Each user story has complete implementation tasks
- [x] Final phase covers polish and cross-cutting concerns
- [x] MVP scope clearly defined

## Task Specificity

- [x] Each task is specific enough for LLM implementation
- [x] File paths are clearly specified for each task
- [x] Tasks can be executed independently within phases
- [x] Test criteria are defined for each user story
- [x] Success metrics are specified

## Alignment with Design

- [x] Tasks align with architectural plan requirements
- [x] All functional requirements from spec are addressed
- [x] Non-functional requirements are considered
- [x] Implementation phases match architectural plan
- [x] Technology stack from plan is reflected in tasks

## Execution Readiness

- [x] Prerequisites and dependencies identified
- [x] Parallel execution opportunities marked
- [x] Story dependency order established
- [x] Independent test criteria defined for each story
- [x] Implementation strategy documented

## Notes

- All tasks validated and ready for implementation.
