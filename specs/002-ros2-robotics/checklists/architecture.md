# Architecture Quality Checklist: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

**Purpose**: Validate architectural plan completeness and quality before proceeding to implementation
**Created**: 2025-12-23
**Feature**: [Link to plan.md](./../plan.md)

## Architecture Quality

- [x] Addresses all functional requirements from spec
- [x] Considers non-functional requirements (performance, security, scalability)
- [x] Aligns with project constitution principles
- [x] Identifies key architectural decisions and trade-offs
- [x] Defines clear system boundaries and components

## Technical Architecture

- [x] Specifies appropriate technology stack for requirements
- [x] Outlines component interactions and dependencies
- [x] Addresses data flow and storage requirements
- [x] Considers security implications and measures
- [x] Plans for performance and scalability needs

## Implementation Architecture

- [x] Provides clear implementation phases
- [x] Identifies dependencies and potential blockers
- [x] Addresses deployment and hosting requirements
- [x] Plans for testing and validation approach
- [x] Considers maintenance and evolution

## Risk Management

- [x] Identifies significant technical risks
- [x] Proposes mitigation strategies
- [x] Considers operational risks
- [x] Addresses security risks

## Quality Assurance

- [x] Defines testing strategy
- [x] Outlines quality validation measures
- [x] Addresses documentation requirements
- [x] Plans for code review and validation processes

## Compliance

- [x] Follows architectural standards from constitution
- [x] Considers accessibility requirements
- [x] Addresses performance requirements
- [x] Plans for monitoring and observability

## Notes

- All items validated and plan is ready for implementation.
