# Implementation Plan: NVIDIA Isaac™ Robot Training Module

**Branch**: `001-nvidia-isaac-robot-training` | **Date**: 2025-12-23 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-nvidia-isaac-robot-training/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Create a Docusaurus documentation site for Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™), including three chapters covering Isaac Sim Fundamentals, Isaac ROS for Perception and Navigation, and Nav2 for Bipedal Humanoid Movement. The site will provide educational content for students with foundational ROS 2, Gazebo, and Unity knowledge to learn advanced AI perception, navigation, and control in humanoid robots using NVIDIA Isaac™ tools.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript/TypeScript, Node.js v18+ (required for Docusaurus)
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus v3, React, Node.js, npm/yarn
**Storage**: N/A (documentation site, no database required)
**Testing**: Jest for unit tests, Cypress for E2E tests (if needed)
**Target Platform**: Web-based documentation site, accessible via browser
**Project Type**: Web application (static site generated by Docusaurus)
**Performance Goals**: Fast loading pages, SEO optimized, responsive design
**Constraints**: Must be accessible to students with foundational ROS 2 knowledge; mobile-friendly; offline-readable if possible
**Scale/Scope**: Educational content for students learning NVIDIA Isaac tools; approximately 3 chapters with hands-on exercises

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Based on the project constitution (which is currently a template), this documentation project follows the core principles:
- Will be structured with clear separation of content and presentation
- Will include appropriate testing for the documentation site functionality
- Will be observable through standard web analytics if needed
- Will follow simplicity principles by using the standard Docusaurus approach

**Structure Decision**: A dedicated Docusaurus documentation site will be created in the module-3-ai-robot-brain directory. This structure allows for clear separation of the educational content from other parts of the codebase, with three main chapters as specified in the feature requirements. The site will be built with Docusaurus to provide a professional documentation experience with search, navigation, and responsive design.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
